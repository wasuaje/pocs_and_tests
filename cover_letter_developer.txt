With a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Systems Engeneering,  and hands-on experience using Python, Php, Visual Foxpro, Bash, HTML/CSS and some AngularJs and Perl languages to create and implement software applications, I am confident I will be an asset to your organization.

I enjoy being challenged and working on projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me and the success of your organization.

and also:

- Thorough understanding of data structures and algorithms 
- Knowledgeable of back end development best practices
